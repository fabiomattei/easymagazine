-- Version 1.0.4.1

  - added "child-theme-readme.txt" to help with installation  
  - CSS: Added "WordPress" rules for images and alignments
-- Version 1.0.3.2
  - remove mysterious "new line characters from theme files"
-- Version 1.0.3.1
  - NB: Removing a core file from a theme will not be reflected within an automatic update of the theme, which is logically correct.
  -- The contents of the index.php file have been used to overwrite the contents of the home.php file.
  -- The contents of the header.php file have been used to overwrite the contents of the header-home.php file.
  -- revision is only to correct this oversight.
-- Version 1.0.3
  - deprecated the header-home.php and home.php files by adding a tilde (~) character to the beginning of the file name. The functionalty was merged into the index.php file with additonal PHP code, specifically an IF statement to test for the displayed page being the "home page", or the "front page". This will reduce maintenance and potential errors that cropped up due to the extra files.
  -- copies of header-come.php and home.php from version 1.0.2 are still included but will be removed in 1.0.4
  - re-coded footer to programtically write the theme name in the credit line, including recognition of child themes.
  - added additional internationalization code
  - CSS: minor adjustment to ".search-submit" for alignment purposes
  - CSS: changed "pre" element's "width:570px;" to "width:auto;"
  - CSS: added "overflow:hidden" to #bottom

  - changed sidebar text alignment to left (from center); and, corrected screenshot image.

-- Version 1.0.1
